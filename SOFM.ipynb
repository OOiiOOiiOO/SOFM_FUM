    "A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) representation of a higher-dimensional data set while preserving the topological structure of the data.\n",
    "A common example used to teach the principles of SOM is the mapping of colors from their three-dimensional components (red, green, and blue) into two dimensions. The network learns to represent these colors as 3D vectors in a 2D space. In addition to clustering colors into distinct regions, areas with similar properties are usually found adjacent to each other, which is a useful feature of Kohonen maps.[1]\n",

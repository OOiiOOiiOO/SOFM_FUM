    "\n",
    "A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is an unsupervised machine learning method that creates a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data while maintaining its topological structure. A common example for teaching SOM principles is mapping colors from their RGB components into two dimensions. The network learns to represent these colors as 3D vectors in a 2D space, clustering similar colors into adjacent regions, which is a beneficial feature of Kohonen maps.[1]\n",
